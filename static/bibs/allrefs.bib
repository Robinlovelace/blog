  annotation = {Abstract note: The link between the built environment and human behavior has long been of interest to the field of urban planning, but direct assessments of the links between the built environment and physical activity as it influences personal health are still rare in the field. Yet the concepts, theories, and methods used by urban planners provide a foundation for an emerging body of research on the relationship between the built environment and physical activity. Recent research efforts in urban planning have focused on the idea that land use and design policies can be used to increase transit use as well as walking and bicycling. The development of appropriate measures for the built environment and for travel behavior is an essential element of this research. The link between the built environment and travel behavior is then made using theoretical frameworks borrowed from economics, and in particular, the concept of travel as a derived demand. The available evidence lends itself to the argument that a combination of urban design, land use patterns, and transportation systems that promotes walking and bicycling will help create active, healthier, and more livable communities. To provide more conclusive evidence, however, researchers must address the following issues: An alternative to the derived-demand framework must be developed for walking, measures of the built environment must be refined, and more-complete data on walking must be developed. In addition, detailed data on the built environment must be spatially matched to detailed data on travel behavior.}

  annotation = {Abstract note: Correlations are regularly found in space syntax studies between graph-based configurational measures of street networks, represented as lines, and observed movement patterns. This suggests that topological and geometric complexity are critically involved in how people navigate urban grids. This has caused difficulties with orthodox urban modelling, since it has always been assumed that insofar as spatial factors play a role in navigation, it will be on the basis of metric distance. In spite of much experimental evidence from cognitive science that geometric and topological factors are involved in navigation, and that metric distance is unlikely to be the best criterion for navigational choices, the matter has not been convincingly resolved since no method has existed for extracting cognitive information from aggregate flows. Within the space syntax literature it has also remained unclear how far the correlations that are found with syntactic variables at the level of aggregate flows are due to cognitive factors operating at the level of individual movers, or they are simply mathematically probable network effects, that is emergent statistical effects from the structure of line networks, independent of the psychology of navigational choices. Here we suggest how both problems can be resolved, by showing three things: first, how cognitive inferences can be made from aggregate urban flow data and distinguished from network effects; second by showing that urban movement, both vehicular and pedestrian, are shaped far more by the geometrical and topological properties of the grid than by its metric properties; and third by demonstrating that the influence of these factors on movement is a cognitive, not network, effect.}

  annotation = {Abstract note: Many scholars have confirmed the close correlation between street network configurations and pedestrian behavior. To elaborate on this discussion and to analyze the connection between street layout and walking using sophisticated methods, we attempt to capture the links and surrounding network features of urban street patterns. To this end, we employ the following four elements: closeness, betweenness, severance, and efficiency. Our empirical study examines street network configurations via a multi-scale network radius. The results show that locations with closer destinations and areas where people pass more frequently throughout a given network are associated with higher walking volume. Furthermore, a greater resemblance between straight-line and path distances from origins to destinations tend to encourage walking mobility. A longer convex hull, with a maximum radius that covers a wider shape and structure of links, is the most favorable setting for walking within a radius of up to 500m. We confirm that a higher convex hull-shape index reveals more deviation from the circularity of a street network's convex hull. This negatively affects walking within a radius of 1\textendash 2km. We conclude that link and network radius-based attributes of street formations have significant effects on the spatial variations of walking within multi-scale walkable neighborhoods. The framework and results are intended to help with the design of pedestrian-friendly street patterns and to create sustainable and livable cities.}
