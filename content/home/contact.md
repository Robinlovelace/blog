Feel free to get in touch in using the form below.
It may be worth considering contacting me in other ways, however, including:

- On [GitHub](https://github.com/robinlovelace/), by commenting on an existing issue or discussion or creating a new one.
 I put this one first not because I love the world's premier code-sharing side (although I do â™¥) but because I get a *lot* of software questions. For example: "I have got xx, data, can I get xx outputs using one of your tools?" It's good to see these questions but often a most appropriate to ask in an open forum such as GitHub or StackOverflow, because:
  - You're likely to get a response quicker
  - Other people can benefit from your answer (see [here](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/issues/810) for a good example of how to ask a good question on GitHub)
  - I prioritise well-asked questions, ideally with a reproducible example, over vague questions sent directly to me
- On Discord, a great place to ask questions about methods and technology. You can join the Geocompr Discord Server and ask questions here:
[![discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/878051191374876683?label=discord&logo=Discord&color=blue)](https://discord.gg/PMztXYgNxp)
- In a comment below one of the pages on this website. See the bottom of [this page](https://www.robinlovelace.net/publication/lovelace-propensity-2017/) for an example of this in relation to the Propensity to Cycle Tool (note: you need a GitHub account to add comments in this way, as you do to ask questions on GitHub)
- On social media where I can be [found](https://twitter.com/robinlovelace), hopefully with the aim of increasing the signal-to-noise and light-vs-heat ratios on such platforms
- Via my work email address which you can find online if it's directly related to my work
