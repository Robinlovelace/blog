Having recently acquired a new laptop, an [Entroware Proteus](https://www.entroware.com/store/laptops/proteus) (shown below), I had to remind myself how to set-it-up for my needs.
This includes the usual things like document editing, web browsing and email.
But as much of my work involves developing and using R for geographic research it had to have R installed.

I documented the process of upgrading Ubuntu, adding the appropriate software repositories and installing packages in a recent blogpost on the website [geocompr.github.io](https://geocompr.github.io/), the website supporting our open source book [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/).

If you use Ubuntu, or are thinking of switching to Ubuntu (a sensible choice for someone looking for a user-friendly and stable mostly open source operating system), check-out the details here: https://geocompr.github.io/post/2020/installing-r-spatial-ubuntu/

Enjoy!
