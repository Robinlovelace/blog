It's been a whirlwind year. 
Being a dad to a cute baby (who has now turned into an energetic toddler!), moving into a new home, and changing jobs have been life events that have provided precious little time for reflection.
This post provides an opportunity to summarise look back on key things that have happened over the past 12 months in my world and a heads-up to anyone interested on what I've been up to.

Like last [years reflections](https://www.robinlovelace.net/post/2021-reflections/) I'll focus on my professional/vocational/technical achievements with a few family things thrown in there for good measure.

# Moving house

Although one of the last things I did this year, it's the first on my mind.
A house isn't just a place sleep: it's a foundation, a source of strength, a place to call home.
So it was a big moment for me and Katy when we got the keys to our new place.
