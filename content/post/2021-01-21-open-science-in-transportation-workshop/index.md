Today I am presenting at the [Transport Research Board’s 2021 Annual](http://www.trb.org/AnnualMeeting/AnnualMeeting.aspx) meeting, aka [\#TRB2021](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TRB2021).
I say ‘presenting’ but in fact, the talk was a pre-record - see the video below!

Information on the talk can be found [here](https://www.robinlovelace.net/talk/open-access-transport-models-from-collaborative-code-to-citizen-science/).

It’s based on a recently published paper on ‘open access models’ which are both based on open source code and, vitally, are available for use by the public without needing specialist training (Lovelace, Parkin, and Cohen 2020).

It also links to a just-published paper in which I review a range of open source transport planning tools (Lovelace 2021).

See the interactive slides [here](https://www.robinlovelace.net/presentations/2021-01-21-open-source-transport-tools.html).
