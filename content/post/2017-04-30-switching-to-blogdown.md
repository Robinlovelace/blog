I've finally got a new blog post, to test that my new set-up is working, using the wonderful new [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package.

Here's a test plot, to show how it allows R code to be embedded:


``` r
plot(1:9)
```

Now that I have a quick-fire and fun way of getting new content onto the web I expect to be blogging lots more. 

Watch this space!
