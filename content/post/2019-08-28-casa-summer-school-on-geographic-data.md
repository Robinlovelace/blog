Last week I presented at UCL’s summer school which, by all accounts, was a very successful event in which many people learned many new skills.
The presentation format was a refreshing changes from the PowerPoint slides you’re often asked to prepare.
Instead, each presenter was asked to create a reproducible RMarkdown document to present.
The source code was shared with the students, who were encouraged to test the code.

The source code of my RMarkdown document can be found here, on the website support the Geocomputation with R book: https://github.com/geocompr/geocompr.github.io/blob/source/content/post/2019/crs-projections-transformations.Rmd

To see the article itself, head here: https://geocompr.github.io/post/2019/crs-projections-transformations/

A very summary of the content is shown below.
