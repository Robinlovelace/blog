<p>This is a short post about a couple of events in which myself and colleagues will present on our work on building tools for evidence-based decision making and teaching data science skills for transport planning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evidence to Support Active Travel in the Planning System, a talk hosted by the LSSI and with input from the Department for Transport, 13:00 to 14:00 on Tuesday 7th June 2021, sign up <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/evidence-to-support-active-travel-in-the-planning-system-tickets-211640180477">here</a></li>
<li>Propensity to Cycle Tool Advanced Training Workshop, on 9th December 2021. Sign up <a href="https://hopin.com/events/propensity-to-cycle-tool-advanced-training-workshop-b97560b7-2a95-4642-aca0-2973d53f22b2/registration">here</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can see more details at the event descriptions on this website, <a href="https://www.robinlovelace.net/talk/propensity-to-cycle-tool-advanced-training-workshop-2021/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.robinlovelace.net/talk/evidence-to-support-active-travel-in-the-planning-system/">here</a>.</p>
<p>These events come at a time when I’m aiming to increase the policy relevance of my research in preparation for the placement phase of an 18 month fellowship in No. 10 that starts in January 2022.
The following links provide more details on the fellowship:</p>
