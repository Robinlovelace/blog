<h2>Becoming a father</h2>
<p>The most important event in the year for me was becoming a dad.</p>

<p>It has been a life changing experience: being responsible for another (little and very cute) person has certainly shifted my perspective on the world, made me prioritise my time more carefully, and made it harder to plan.</p>
<p>My wife Katy and I have worked closely as a team and, despite talk of the â€˜<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/54670274-baby-bomb">baby bomb</a>â€™ impacting our relationship, little Kit has brought us closer together â™¥</p>
<p>Despite inevitable challenges, itâ€™s been the most rewarding thing weâ€™ve done so far and weâ€™re only 3 months in.
Having a little one around encourages long-term thinking and Kit has strengthened my commitment to research supporting a more sustainable world.</p>

<h2>Just look up â˜„</h2>
<p>Having a baby around on New Yearâ€™s Eve, plus the fact that we start the new year in the midst of a pandemic, led to scaled-back plans to celebrate the arrival of 2022.
To celebrate, Katy and I watched Donâ€™t Look Up, having hear friends talking about it and seeing positive and provoking comments about it on social media, with the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DontLookUp">#DontLookUpâ˜„</a></p>

<p>Never thought I would hear these lyrics in a catchy pop song in 2021:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Get your head out of your as, listen to the goddam qualified scientists</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Iâ€™m prepared for anything in the coming year.
Optimistic that with hard work, our collective intelligence, empathy, and desire to collaborate on solving tricky problems will prevail.
Bring on 2022!</p>
