## Becoming a father

The most important event in the year for me was becoming a dad.


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Big personal news: <a href="https://twitter.com/katylvlace?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@katylvlace</a> and I have had a baby, welcome to the world Kit ðŸŽ‰ Focussed on nappies and supporting the family for the next while ðŸ’šðŸ’šðŸ’š Parenthood is amazing, makes me more committed to research for a sustainable future ðŸŒ± Looking forward to it all! <a href="https://t.co/sJJZNZZV04">pic.twitter.com/sJJZNZZV04</a></p>&mdash; Robin Lovelace (@robinlovelace) <a href="https://twitter.com/robinlovelace/status/1448594909376696322?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

It has been a life changing experience: being responsible for another (little and very cute) person has certainly shifted my perspective on the world, made me prioritise my time more carefully, and made it harder to plan.

My wife Katy and I have worked closely as a team and, despite talk of the '[baby bomb](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/54670274-baby-bomb)' impacting our relationship, little Kit has brought us closer together â™¥

Despite inevitable challenges, it's been the most rewarding thing we've done so far and we're only 3 months in.
Having a little one around encourages long-term thinking and Kit has strengthened my commitment to research supporting a more sustainable world.

## Just look up â˜„

Having a baby around on New Year's Eve, plus the fact that we start the new year in the midst of a pandemic, led to scaled-back plans to celebrate the arrival of 2022.
To celebrate, Katy and I watched Don't Look Up, having hear friends talking about it and seeing positive and provoking comments about it on social media, with the hashtag [#DontLookUpâ˜„](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DontLookUp)

Never thought I would hear these lyrics in a catchy pop song in 2021:

> Get your head out of your as, listen to the goddam qualified scientists

So I'm prepared for anything in the coming year.
Optimistic that with hard work, our collective intelligence, empathy, and desire to collaborate on solving tricky problems will prevail.
Bring on 2022!
