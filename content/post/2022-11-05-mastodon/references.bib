  abstract = {Increases in cost, stability, more commercial support, and ease of software development facilitate people moving to proprietary solutions while for better security, free support, and ease of software development, people tend to move to open-source solutions. Across all segments of ICT, users move toward open source as they get ``free online support' for open-source products. People prefer proprietary products as they wish to have ``commercial support.' Adoption of open-source software is proliferating, because of the huge cost saving in software systems.},
