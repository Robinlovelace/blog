Even the founder of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, signalled his regret about the direction of travel of the platform that he pioneered:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Folks at Twitter past and present are strong and resilient. They will always find a way no matter how difficult the moment. I realize many are angry with me. I own the responsibility for why everyone is in this situation: I grew the company size too quickly. I apologize for that.</p>&mdash; jack (@jack) <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1588913276980633600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
