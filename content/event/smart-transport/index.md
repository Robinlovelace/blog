summary:
abstract: Robin Lovelace is Associate Professor of Transport Data Science at the Leeds Institute for Transport Studies (ITS) specialising in the analysis of regional transport systems and modelling scenarios of change. Robin is Lead Developer of the Propensity to Cycle Tool (see www.pct.bike), and led the ActDev project, which demonstrates the feasibility of a nationally scalable tool to provide evidence on active travel provision and potential in and around new housing development. Now working on a fellowship in the No. 10 Data Science team (10DS), Robin will be working over the coming year on using new datasets and data science techniques to support the transition away from fossil fuels in the transport system, in a way that maximises health and equality opportunities associated with reduce car dependency and increases levels of walking, cycling and shared and public transport modes.
