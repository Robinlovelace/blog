# Abstract

This talk will discuss the impacts of making transport models, and the 
data and tools for decision-making in participatory democracies using 
open source, accessible, and transparent methods. It will build on 
recent research into the rapid growth of [open source software](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10109-020-00342-2) and [open access and participatory transport models](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967070X19302781)that go beyond technologies developed in the 20th Century, using cutting-edge and community-built software to better meet the needs of the 21st.  A/B Street ([abstreet.org](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fabstreet.org%2F&data=05%7C01%7CR.Lovelace%40leeds.ac.uk%7C674bac2463314ae98d8008daf94d9423%7Cbdeaeda8c81d45ce863e5232a535b7cb%7C1%7C0%7C638096408853052543%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=tDiCbyiysgPT%2FUd5pjL65rSxpcsvsbI58C4U1Hkvo4U%3D&reserved=0))
 is an open-source multi-modal traffic simulator designed for the 
general public to explore low-cost approaches for reducing motor vehicle
 use. Starting from OpenStreetMap data and a variety of travel demand 
sources, people using A/B Street can modify roads (like transforming 
street parking into bike- and bus-only lanes) and intersections (traffic
 signal timing). Using built-in elevation data, visualizations about 
individual trips and aggregate groups, and measurements of impact on 
travel time and risk exposure, interested citizens can present their 
idea to a city council for consideration. There are also 
non-simulation-based tools for analyzing 15-minute neighbourhood 
accessibility and designing low-traffic neighbourhoods. This talk will 
first briefly introduce the project and some of the technical aspects.
