In place of a planned [MUSA Masterclass](https://penniur.upenn.edu/events/musamasterclass-featuring-tyler-morgan-wall-3d-mapping-dataviz-in-r) talk in person, a remote lecture was scheduled via the wonders of new [digital technologies](https://twitter.com/robinlovelace/status/1239930988416897033), on transport data science.

Although not as in-depth as the MUSA Masterclass talk, which has been postponed until April 2021 due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, this talk will give a high-level overview of some of the topics that I will talk about, based on a case study from Leeds, UK, the home of the Institute for Transport Studies.

Context: the ‘MUSA Masterclass’ is a series of seminars commissioned by the Penn
Institute for Urban Research ([Penn IUR](https://penniur.upenn.edu/)) of
the University of [Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu).

It’s great being able to link-up over such huge distances with minimal effort, the new technologies like Zoom are impressive.
In the hope that this is of use to others, I put links out to the slides and talk out on social media, as shown in the tweets below.
Enjoy!
