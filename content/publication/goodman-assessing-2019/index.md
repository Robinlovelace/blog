abstract: "Background Cycling to school has large potential health benefits, ensuring\
  \ children get regular daily exercise. This paper demonstrates and implements a\
  \ method for estimating the potential for modal switch to cycling for the school\
  \ commute down to the route network level across England. Methods Input data from\
  \ the 2011 School Census, provided by the English Department for Education, comprised\
  \ two main tables: a school-level dataset representing 21,523 educational institutions\
  \ and an origin-destination (OD) level dataset, containing around 50 desire lines\
  \ per school. The method focused on the 1.37 million secondary school children (age\
  \ 11-18) travelling less than 15km to school. For each of the 134,274 OD pairs we\
  \ route distance and hilliness were estimated using the CycleStreets.net routing\
  \ service. Current and potential levels of cycling were modeled as a function of\
  \ distance and hilliness. This included using Dutch National Travel Survey to create\
  \ a 'Go Dutch' scenario English children cycled as much as children in the Netherlands,\
  \ accounting for route distance and hilliness. Results Among those travelling less\
  \ than 15km, the current percentage of children cycling to school in England is\
  \ 2.7%. Our model of cycling potential highlights areas and routes with particularly\
  \ high cycling potential, to help prioritize investment in safe routes to school.\
  \ The scenarios show the scale of transformation possible in school travel patterns:\
  \ 'Going Dutch' would see over two-thirds of these children cycle to school, approaching\
  \ the level observed in The Netherlands, higher than the 27% cycle mode share in\
  \ an equivalent 'Go Dutch' scenario for cycling to work, implying that the potential\
  \ uptake of cycling for travel to school could be even higher, as a percentage of\
  \ trips, than the potential for cycling to work. Conclusions This paper highlights\
  \ the very high potential of school trips to be cycled and suggest it should be\
  \ a priority target for health-conscious transport policy. To our knowledge, this\
  \ is the first time that a national database on school travel at the level has been\
  \ analysed from a 'safe routes to school' perspective at high geographical resolution,\
  \ down to the route network level. The methods could be deployed in other settings\
  \ where travel to school data is available at the OD level to inform investments\
  \ in safe routes to school, where they are most needed."
