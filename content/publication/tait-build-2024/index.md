abstract: Contraflow cycling on one-way streets is a safe, low cost intervention that
  can improve the cycling experience. The evidence of its impact on cycling participation
  is patchy and limited. In this paper, we use crowd-sourced data to assess the impact
  of introducing contraflow cycling on cycling volumes and qualitatively assess factors
  that are associated with impact of such infrastructure. We matched roads where contraflow
  cycling was introduced in London in 2018/2019 with monthly Strava Metro cycling
  count data before and after the intervention. We generated expected counts adjusted
  for changes in Strava trips, users and seasonality by examining global change in
  Strava counts during the study period. We used national cycle infrastructure design
  guidance and Google Street View to qualitatively assess the contraflow infrastructure.
  Twenty-eight one-way streets and fourteen two-way streets (converted to one-way
  streets) introduced contraflow cycling. Illegal contraflow cycling was popular on
  some streets pre-introduction. Three streets experienced significant increases in
  mean contraflow trips (260, 630 and 1750 percent) and people after introduction
  that were much higher than expected. Many other streets had higher counts post-intervention.
  Count increases were less apparent for the former two-way roads. Qualitative assessment
  demonstrated that local context such as connectivity, physical infrastructure and
  external factors (e.g. construction) were important in determining whether the intervention
  increased contraflow cycling. We found that contraflow cycling introduction can
  increase cycling participation but that local factors are important in determining
  volumes. Large-scale adoption of such infrastructure could significantly improve
  cycle routes and networks. Legislative change to make all one-way streets contraflow
  by default would facilitate such implementation. Further work could utilise other
  data sources to assess the representativeness of the Strava Metro data and confirm
  these findings with a more comprehensive analysis that explore multiple factors
  including local factors and weather conditions.
