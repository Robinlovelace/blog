abstract: 'Contraflow cycling on one-way streets is a low cost intervention that research
  shows can improve the cycling experience and increase participation. Evidence from
  several studies suggest that cyclists on contraflows have a lower crash risk. However,
  implementing contraflow cycling is often controversial, including in the United
  Kingdom (UK). In this paper we examine whether contraflow cycling on one-way streets
  alters crash or casualty rates for pedal cyclists. Focusing on inner London boroughs
  between 1998 and 2019, we identified 508 road segments where contraflow cycling
  was introduced on one-way streets. We identified road traffic crashes occurring
  within 10~m of these segments and labelled them as pre-contraflow, contraflow or
  contraflow removed crashes. We calculated rates using the number of crashes or casualties
  divided by the time exposed and generated 95~% confidence intervals using bootstrap
  resampling. We adjusted the rates for changes in cordon cycling volume and injury
  severity reporting. There were 1498 crashes involving pedal cyclists: 788 pre-contraflow,
  703 contraflow and 7 following contraflow removal. There was no change in adjusted
  overall pedal cyclist crash or casualty rates when contraflow cycling was introduced.
  Proximity to a junction doubled the crash rate. The crash rate when pedal cyclists
  were travelling contraflow was the same as those travelling with flow. We have found
  no evidence that introducing contraflow cycling increases the crash or casualty
  rate for pedal cyclists. It is possible that such rates may indeed fall when contraflow
  cycling is introduced if more accurate spatio-temporal cycling volume data was available.
  We recommend all one-way streets are evaluated for contraflow cycling but encourage
  judicious junction design and recommend UK legislative change for mandatory-two-way
  cycling on one-way streets unless exceptional circumstances exist.'
