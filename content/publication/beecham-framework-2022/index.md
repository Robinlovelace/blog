abstract: Road safety research is a data-rich field with large social impacts. Like
  in medical research, the ambition is to build knowledge around risk factors that
  can save lives. Unlike medical research, road safety research generates empirical
  findings from messy observational datasets. Records of road crashes contain numerous
  intersecting categorical variables, dominating patterns that are complicated by
  confounding and, when conditioning on data to make inferences net of this, observed
  effects that are subject to uncertainty due to diminishing sample sizes. We demonstrate
  how visual data analysis approaches can inject rigor into exploratory analysis of
  such datasets. A framework is presented whereby graphics are used to expose, model
  and evaluate spatial patterns in observational data, as well as protect against
  false discovery. Evidence for the framework is presented through an applied data
  analysis of national crash patterns recorded in STATS19, the main source of road
  crash information in Great Britain. Our framework moves beyond typical depictions
  of exploratory data analysis and transfers to complex data analysis decision spaces
  characteristic of modern geographical analysis.
