abstract: 'Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF), also known as biproportional fitting,
  ‘raking’ or the RAS algorithm, is an established procedure used in a variety of
  applications across the social sciences. Primary amongst these for urban modelling
  has been its use in static spatial microsimulation to generate small area microdata
  — individual level data allocated to administrative zones. The technique is mature,
  widely used and relatively straight-forward. Although IPF is well described mathematically,
  accessible examples of the algorithm written in modern programming languages are
  rare. There is a tendency for researchers to ‘start from scratch’, resulting in
  a variety of ad hoc implementations and little evidence about the relative merits
  of differing approaches. These knowledge gaps mean that answers to certain methodological
  questions must be guessed: How can ‘empty cells’ be identified and how do they influence
  model fit? Can IPF be made more computationally efficient? This paper tackles these
  questions and more using a systematic methodology with publicly available code and
  data. The results demonstrate the sensitivity of the results to initial conditions,
  notably the presence of ‘empty cells’, and the dramatic impact of software decisions
  on computational efficiency. The paper concludes by proposing an agenda for robust
  and transparent future tests in the field.'
