abstract: Pedal cycling is advocated for increasing physical activity and promoting
  health and wellbeing. However, whilst some countries have achieved zero cyclist
  deaths on their roads, this is not the case for Great Britain (GB). A retrospective
  cross-sectional analysis was conducted of STATS19 cyclist crash data, a dataset
  of all police-reported traffic crashes in GB. Information about crash location,
  casualty, driver and vehicles involved were included as predictors of casualty severity
  (fatal or severe vs. slight). Sixteen thousand one hundred seventy pedal cycle crashes
  were reported during 2018. Severe or fatal cyclist crash injury was associated with
  increasing age of the cyclist (35–39~years, OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.73; 55–59~years,
  OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.2; 70~years and over, OR 2.87, 95% CI 2.12 to 3.87), higher
  road speed limits (50 MPH OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.43 to 3.07; 70 MPH OR 4.12, 95% CI 2.12
  to 8.03), the involvement of goods vehicles (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.30 to 3.33) and the
  months of May and June (OR 1.34 to 1.36, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.73). Urban planning that
  includes physical separation of pedal cyclists from other road users, raising awareness
  around the risks from goods vehicles and reducing road speed should be the urgent
  focus of interventions to increase the benefits and safety of cycling.
