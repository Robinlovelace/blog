abstract: Cycling has a range of health, environmental and economic benefits compared
  with motorised forms of transport. There is a need to encourage more cycling, yet
  previous evaluations of cycling promotion schemes have been inconclusive about what
  works. A case study of a cycling promotion scheme at the University of Sheffield
  – the Cycle Challenge – is used in this paper to examine commuting behaviour and
  long-term behavioural shifts towards cycling in response to outside intervention
  at the organisational level. The Cycle Challenge was designed to encourage more
  people at the University to cycle through inter-departmental competition. Cycling
  behaviour was recorded before the Cycle Challenge and two years after the scheme’s
  completion. It was found that seventy five percent of participants who were not
  already regular cyclists reported increased cycling, yet the overall impact of this
  shift was limited because the majority of participants already cycled regularly.
  This failure to attract new cyclists suggests recruiting non-cyclists should be
  a priority in future schemes. Moreover, our study has methodological implications.
  Current strategies for evaluating the positive impact of cycle initiatives may overestimate
  the savings by neglecting the tendency of people to resume routine behaviour in
  the long run. Studies evaluating modal shift should therefore include provision
  for monitoring long-term behavioural change to provide input into estimated economic,
  environmental or health metrics of success.
