abstract: Introduction We describe and analyse a new, open dataset of surveyed cycling
  infrastructure in London UK. We demonstrate its potential to contribute to research
  and evidence-based policy development through a spatial analysis of infrastructure
  provision in London, before evaluating administrative boroughs on their infrastructure
  mix and compliance with UK Cycle Infrastructure Design Standards. Methods We processed
  and cleaned the 233,596 records in the London Cycling Infrastructure Database (CID)
  that contains nine infrastructure types. To support comparison between London boroughs,
  infrastructure provision was normalised to borough area, population size and level
  of commuter cycling. We generated variables capturing cyclist separation from motor
  vehicles and estimated cycle lane compliance for such segregation against design
  standards. Results Each CID record contains the infrastructure survey date, spatial
  location, infrastructure-specific variables and accompanying photographs. Traffic
  calming assets are numerous and distributed throughout London. Cyclist signals,
  crossings, Advanced Stop Lanes and cycle lanes and tracks are less numerous and
  more commonly seen in inner rather than outer London. Normalisation by area and
  population did not change these spatial patterns. Six percent of on-road cycle lane
  length is physically segregated from vehicles. Estimated compliance with UK design
  standards was notably higher for inner London boroughs with 66% exceeding mean compliance
  compared to just 24% of outer London boroughs. Conclusions In this first systematic
  description and analysis of the CID we have demonstrated its potential to quantitively
  and qualitatively compare infrastructure and a method to estimate compliance against
  design standards. We found that cycling infrastructure is not distributed equally
  across London and may not be of the quality that provides safe space for cycling.
  Such datasets are critical assets to evaluate infrastructure and guide health and
  transport policies.
