abstract: 'A large and growing body of evidence suggests fundamental changes are needed
  in transport systems, to tackle issues such as air pollution, physical inactivity
  and climate change. Transport models can play a major role in tackling these issues
  through the transport planning process, but they have historically been focussed
  on motorised modes (especially cars) and available only to professional transport
  planners working within the existing paradigm. Building on the principles of open
  access software, first developed in the context of geographic information systems,
  this paper develops and discusses the concept of open access transport models, which
  we define as models that are both developed using open source software and are available
  to be used by the public without the need for specialist training or the purchase
  of software licences. We explore the future potential of open access transport models
  to support the transition away from fossil fuels in the transport sector. We do
  this with reference to the literature on the use of tools in the planning process,
  and by exploring an example that is already in use: the ‘Propensity to Cycle Tool’.
  We conclude that open access transport models can be a leverage point in the planning
  process due to their ability to provide robust, transparent and actionable evidence
  that is available to a range of stakeholders, not just professional transport planners.
  Open access transport models represent a disruptive technology deserving further
  research and development, by planners, researchers and citizen scientists, including
  open source software developers and advocacy groups but, in order to fulfil their
  potential, they will require both financial and policy support from government bodies.'
