abstract: Car fleets across much of Europe have undergone a process of dieselisation
  over the past 20,years. Understanding the factors driving this process is therefore
  important for sustainable transport policy, with implications for how governments
  steer their national car fleets towards ultra-low emission vehicles in the future.
  At a general level, this paper contributes to this wider body of work which aims
  to understand the factors which led to the transition from petrol to diesel. Specifically,
  the paper investigates whether the availability of relatively cheap diesel fuel
  in the Republic of Ireland affected the rate of diesel car ownership in Northern
  Ireland. A geographic approach is used, which involves generating spatial variables
  measuring nearness to the Republic of Ireland and comparing these with the proportion
  of the local car stock that is fuelled by diesel. A series of spatial regression
  models are specified to determine if this association between nearness to the Republic
  and diesel ownership persists after accounting for the effect of socioeconomic,
  travel, and household characteristics. The results support the hypothesis that the
  availability of cheaper fuel in the Republic of Ireland is not only generating fuel-tourism,
  but is also affecting the structure of the car fleet registered in Northern Ireland.
  The findings are relevant beyond the case study and imply that the structure of
  a countryâ€™s car fleet is not only dependent on domestic policies, but is also affected
  by the policies of neighbouring countries.
