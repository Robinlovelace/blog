abstract: 'The development and delivery of ICT-based persuasive strategies for the
  adoption of more environmental-friendly modes of transport is an emerging strategy
  to help tackle the problem of excessive use of individual Conventionally Fueled
  Vehicles (CFVs). The efficiency of this approach, like other information-based schemes,
  can benefit from the knowledge of which groups of individuals are more responsive
  to these types of interventions. The goal of this study is to examine the level
  of acceptability of persuasive schemes delivered using smartphone applications across
  different population segments. A cross-sectional survey was applied to 920 university
  students in Curitiba, a roughly 2-million inhabitant Brazilian city. The questionnaire
  was developed considering two groups of indicators: individual determinants of travel
  behavior, which were extracted from theories of social psychology (i.e. the Theory
  of Planned Behavior, the Norm-Activation Model and others), as well as stated intentions
  and attitudes toward a range of eleven different persuasive strategies (money or
  voucher rewards, points and rankings, social media sharing, etc.). Groups with different
  psychographic profiles were extracted from the sample using cluster and discriminant
  analyses. The acceptability of persuasive strategies were compared between segments.
  Results show a higher individual preference toward financial rewards and a relatively
  lower acceptability of social media tools. The acceptance level of groups that display
  higher control over the use of non-motorized forms of transport is higher than groups
  that are more psychologically predisposed to CFVs.'
