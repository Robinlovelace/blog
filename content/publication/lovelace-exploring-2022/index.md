abstract: 'Origin-Destination (OD) datasets provide vital information on how people
  travel between areas in many cities, regions and countries worldwide. OD datasets
  are usually represented geographically with straight lines or routes between zone
  centroids. For active travel, this geographic representation has substantial limitations,
  especially when zone origins and centroids are large: only using a single centroid
  origin/destination for each large zone results in sparse route networks covering
  only a small fraction of likely walking and cycling routes. This paper implements
  and explores the use of jittering and different routing options to overcome this
  limitation, thereby adding value to aggregate OD data to support investment in sustainable
  transport infrastructure. The route network results --- generated from on an open
  dataset representing cycling trips in Lisbon, Portugal --- were compared with a
  ground-truth dataset from 67 count locations distributed throughout the city. This
  approach enabled exploration of which jittering parameters and routing options lead
  to the most accurate route network results approximating the real geographic distribution
  of cycling trips in the study area. We found that jittering and disaggregating OD
  data, combined with routing using low level of traffic stress (quieter) preferences
  resulted in the most accurate route networks. We conclude that a combined approach
  involving 1) jittering with intermediate levels of disaggregation and 2) careful
  selection of routing options can lead to much more realistic route networks than
  using established OD processing techniques. The methods can be deployed to support
  evidence-based investment in strategic cycling and other sustainable transport networks
  in cities worldwide.'
