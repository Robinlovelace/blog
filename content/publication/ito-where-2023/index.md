abstract: A lack of cycle parking is a known barrier to promoting the uptake of cycling
  in urban areas. Unlike cars that can be parked on the roadside with little additional
  infrastructure, bikes usually require dedicated parking facilities. The existing
  research and guidance on where cycle parking should be provided primarily focuses
  on key destinations such as train stations or schools. Thus, there is a gap in knowledge
  about the amount of general-purpose cycle parking required and how it should be
  distributed across a city. This paper presents a novel method for analysing and
  prioritising the spatial distribution of cycle parking. The method draws on established
  portfolio management techniques but applies them in a spatial context. Using the
  case study of London, we demonstrate that it is possible to identify areas that
  have a deficit of cycle parking as well as locations that have the most significant
  potential for increasing cycling uptake by providing additional cycle parking.
