abstract: Geographic analysis has long supported transport plans that are appropriate
  to local contexts. Many incumbent ‘tools of the trade’ are proprietary and were
  developed to support growth in motor traffic, limiting their utility for transport
  planners who have been tasked with twenty-first century objectives such as enabling
  citizen participation, reducing pollution, and increasing levels of physical activity
  by getting more people walking and cycling. Geographic techniques—such as route
  analysis, network editing, localised impact assessment and interactive map visualisation—have
  great potential to support modern transport planning priorities. The aim of this
  paper is to explore emerging open source tools for geographic analysis in transport
  planning, with reference to the literature and a review of open source tools that
  are already being used. A key finding is that a growing number of options exist,
  challenging the current landscape of proprietary tools. These can be classified
  as command-line interface, graphical user interface or web-based user interface
  tools and by the framework in which they were implemented, with numerous tools released
  as R, Python and JavaScript packages, and QGIS plugins. The review found a diverse
  and rapidly evolving ‘ecosystem’ tools, with 25 tools that were designed for geographic
  analysis to support transport planning outlined in terms of their popularity and
  functionality based on online documentation. They ranged in size from single-purpose
  tools such as the QGIS plugin AwaP to sophisticated stand-alone multi-modal traffic
  simulation software such as MATSim, SUMO and Veins. Building on their ability to
  re-use the most effective components from other open source projects, developers
  of open source transport planning tools can avoid ‘reinventing the wheel’ and focus
  on innovation, the ‘gamified’ A/B Street https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/#abstreetsimulation
  software, based on OpenStreetMap, a case in point. The paper, the source code of
  which can be found at https://github.com/robinlovelace/open-gat, concludes that,
  although many of the tools reviewed are still evolving and further research is needed
  to understand their relative strengths and barriers to uptake, open source tools
  for geographic analysis in transport planning already hold great potential to help
  generate the strategic visions of change and evidence that is needed by transport
  planners in the twenty-first century.
