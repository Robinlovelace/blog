abstract: Understanding the motivators and deterrents to cycling is essential for
  creating infrastructure that gets more people to adopt cycling as a mode of transport.
  This paper demonstrates a new approach to support the prioritization of cycling
  infrastructure and cycling network design, accounting for cyclist preferences and
  the growing emphasis on ‘filtered permeability’ and ‘Low Traffic Neighborhood’ interventions
  internationally. The approach combines distance decay, route calculation, and network
  analysis methods to examine where future cycling demand is most likely to arise,
  how such demand could be accommodated within existing street networks, and how to
  ensure a fair distribution of investment. Although each of these methods has been
  applied to cycling infrastructure prioritization in previous research, this is the
  first time that they have been combined, creating an integrated road segment prioritization
  approach. The approach, which can be applied to other cities, is demonstrated in
  a case study of Manchester, resulting in cycling networks that balance directness
  against the need for safe and stress-free routes under different investment scenarios.
  A key benefit of the approach from a policy perspective is its ability to support
  egalitarian and cost-effective strategic cycle network planning.
