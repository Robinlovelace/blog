abstract: Introduction The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) is a widely used free, open
  source and publicly available tool for modelling cycling uptake and corresponding
  health and carbon impacts in England and Wales. In this paper we present the methods
  for our new individual-level modelling representing all commuters in England and
  Wales. Methods Scenario commuter cycling potential in the PCT is modelled as a function
  of route distance and hilliness between home and work. Our new individual-level
  approach has allowed us to create an additional ``Near Market'' scenario where age,
  gender, ethnicity, car ownership and area level deprivation also affect an individual's
  likelihood of switching to cycling. For this and other scenarios, we calculate the
  carbon benefits of cycling uptake based on the trip distance and previous mode,
  while health benefits are additionally affected by hilliness and baseline average
  mortality risk. This allows the estimation of how health and carbon benefits differ
  by demographic group as well as by scenario. Results While cycle commuting in England
  and Wales is demographically skewed towards men and white people, women and people
  from ethnic minorities have greater cycling potential based on route distance and
  hilliness. Benefits from cycling uptake are distributed differently again. For example,
  while increasing female cycling mode share is good for equity, each additional female
  cyclist generates a smaller average health and carbon benefit than a male cyclist.
  This is based on women's lower baseline mortality risk, shorter commute travel distances,
  and lower propensity to commute by car than men. Conclusion We have demonstrated
  a new approach to modelling that allows for more sophisticated and nuanced assessment
  of cycling uptake and subsequent benefits, under different scenarios. Health and
  carbon are increasingly incorporated into appraisal of active travel schemes, valuing
  important outcomes. However, especially with better representation of demographic
  factors, this can act as a barrier to equity goals.
