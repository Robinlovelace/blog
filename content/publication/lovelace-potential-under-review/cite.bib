 abstract = {Methods for estimating cycling potential for single-mode trips are well-established. Less attention has been paid to the question of how to promote cycling as the first leg of multi-stage trips involving public transport (PT). This  `bike & ride' option has many potential benefits: boosting the level of cycling beyond that attainable through promotion of single-mode cycle trips alone; reducing car dependency in suburban areas not generally viewed as having high cycling potential; and reviving demand for PT services. But how to plan for `bike & ride' uptake? This paper presents a reproducible method for estimating bike & ride potential, based on geographic analysis of catchment areas and stated preference surveys of the relevant population. We illustrate the method using a case study of Seville, with insights into suitable locations for new cycle paths and appropriately sized cycle parking facilities to encourage bike & ride uptake. Deployed in other cities, we conclude that these methods could provide a strong evidence base for the cost-effective investment in new suburban cycling infrastructure.},
