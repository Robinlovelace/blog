abstract: 'There has been much excitement among quantitative geographers about newly
  available data sets, characterized by high volume, velocity, and variety. This phenomenon
  is often labeled as “Big Data” and has contributed to methodological and empirical
  advances, particularly in the areas of visualization and analysis of social networks.
  However, a fourth v—veracity (or lack thereof)—has been conspicuously lacking from
  the literature. This article sets out to test the potential for verifying large
  data sets. It does this by cross-comparing three unrelated estimates of retail flows—human
  movements from home locations to shopping centers—derived from the following geo-coded
  sources: (1) a major mobile telephone service provider; (2) a commercial consumer
  survey; and (3) geotagged Twitter messages. Three spatial interaction models also
  provided estimates of flow: constrained and unconstrained versions of the “gravity
  model” and the recently developed “radiation model.” We found positive relationships
  between all data-based and theoretical sources of estimated retail flows. Based
  on the analysis, the mobile telephone data fitted the modeled flows and consumer
  survey data closely, while flows obtained directly from the Twitter data diverged
  from other sources. The research highlights the importance of verification in flow
  data derived from new sources and demonstrates methods for achieving this.'
