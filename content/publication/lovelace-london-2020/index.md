abstract: Pro-cycling interventions, and cycle hire schemes in particular, are often
  assumed to primarily benefit the privileged. This framing has played-out in academic
  research, with many papers exploring the relationship between cycling and existing
  inequalities. A growing body of evidence suggests that cycle hire schemes tend to
  serve wealthy areas and young, high income groups, mirroring inequalities in other
  types of cycling uptake, yet there has been little research into the ‘direction
  of travel’ and whether such inequalities are growing or ‘levelling up’ over time.
  This paper explores the uptake of the London Cycle Hire Scheme (LCHS), a large,
  early and prominent scheme that had the explicit aim of ‘normalising’ cycling. The
  method involved reproducible analysis (with code documented in the GitHub repo Robinlovelace/cycle-hire-inclusive)
  of 73.4 million cycle high records spanning 8~years from January 2012 to December
  2019, using the geographic location of docking stations alongside official statistics
  to assess social and spatial inequalities in uptake. The method involved analysis
  of 73.4 million cycle high records spanning 8~years from January 2012 to December
  2019, using the geographic location of docking stations alongside official statistics
  to assess social and spatial inequalities in uptake. We found that, contrary to
  the trend for increasing segregation and geographic inequalities, the usage of the
  LCHS have become increasingly geographically distributed across London over time,
  with AM peak usage in comparatively low-income areas seeing high levels of growth.
  Our study shows that cycle hire schemes can be designed and expanded in ways that
  benefit a wide range of people, including those from low income areas, and that
  new cycle hire docking stations in poorer areas can succeed.
