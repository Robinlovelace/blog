abstract: The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) has revolutionised strategic cycle planning
  in England and Wales. This evidence-based tool quantifies cycling potential at national,
  city and street scales, leading to the creation of joined-up networks available
  to millions of people. The PCT has been used by $>$35,000 transport planners, consultants,
  advocates and members of the public, directly influencing the design and construction
  of cost-effective cycle networks worth $>$GBP500,000,000. The tool informed the
  majority of UK local authority applications to the GBP250,000,000 government COVID-19
  Emergency Active Travel Fund. Planners across Europe, USA, Australia and New Zealand
  have adopted the approach internationally.
