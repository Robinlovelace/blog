abstract: Getting people cycling is an increasingly common objective in transport
  planning institutions worldwide. A growing evidence base indicates that high quality
  infrastructure can boost local cycling rates. Yet for infrastructure and other cycling
  measures to be effective, it is important to intervene in the right places, such
  as along ‘desire lines’ of high latent demand. This creates the need for tools and
  methods to help answer the question ‘where to build?’. Following a brief review
  of the policy and research context related to this question, this paper describes
  the design, features and potential applications of such a tool. The Propensity to
  Cycle Tool (PCT) is an online, interactive planning support system that was initially
  developed to explore and map cycling potential across England (see www.pct.bike).
  Based on origin-destination data it models cycling levels at area, desire line,
  route and route network levels, for current levels of cycling, and for scenario-based
  ‘cycling futures.’ Four scenarios are presented, including ‘Go Dutch’ and ‘Ebikes,’
  which explore what would happen if English people had the same propensity to cycle
  as Dutch people and the potential impact of electric cycles on cycling uptake. The
  cost effectiveness of investment depends not only on the number of additional trips
  cycled, but on wider impacts such as health and carbon benefits. The PCT reports
  these at area, desire line, and route level for each scenario. The PCT is open source,
  facilitating the creation of scenarios and deployment in new contexts. We conclude
  that the PCT illustrates the potential of online tools to inform transport decisions
  and raises the wider issue of how models should be used in transport planning.
