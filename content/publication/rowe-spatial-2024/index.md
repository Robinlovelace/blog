abstract: 'Spatial interaction models (SIMs) are a core tool in spatial data modelling
  to predict spatial flows and understand their underpinning factors. SIMs have been
  applied to provide data insights and support decision making in multiple settings,
  notably in transport, human mobility, migration and epidemiology. While considerable
  progress has been made on advancing the theoretical and methodological underpinnings
  of SIMs, key challenges remain to facilitate the application of SIMs, extend existing
  modelling approaches and leverage the opportunities afforded by Big Data. We identify
  three key challenges: reproducibility, calibration and Big Data modelling. We propose
  a blueprint to tackle these challenges by identifying our areas of development:
  (1) to enable essential infrastructure to facilitate the training, calibration and
  reproducibility of SIMs; (2) to embrace modelling frameworks to capture spatial,
  temporal and population heterogeneity; (3) to enhance statistical inference to accommodate
  Big Data analysis; and (4) to integrate data science approaches to enhance SIM-generated
  predictions and statistical inference.'
