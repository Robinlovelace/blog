abstract: The London Congestion Charge (LCC) is a transport policy with a precise
  spatial footprint. As such, its impact on the transport system can be expected to
  vary over space, providing an opportunity to explore the geographical reach of local
  transport interventions. This paper assesses whether the exemption of Hybrid Electric
  Vehicles (HEVs) from the LCC affected the registration rate of these vehicles in
  Greater London and the surrounding areas. The analysis uses official data on the
  number of HEVs registered across the local authorities of the United Kingdom. This
  dataset is assessed using [1] exploratory spatial analysis to determine the degree
  of spatial variation in HEV registrations, [2] area classifications to consider
  if HEV registrations diminish as nearness to the LCC recedes, and [3] spatial regression
  models to evaluate the association between distance to the LCC and HEV registrations,
  controlling for other area characteristics (i.e. socioeconomic, household, and transport
  system variables). The results clearly show that nearness to the LCC is positively
  associated with HEV registrations, implying that this form of transport policy is
  effective at promoting the adoption of low emission vehicles.
