abstract: "Geocomputation with Python is a comprehensive resource for working with\
  \ geographic data with the most popular programming language in the world. The book\
  \ gives an overview of Python's capabilities for spatial data analysis, as well\
  \ as dozens of worked-through examples covering the entire range of standard GIS\
  \ operations. A unique selling point of the book is its cohesive and joined-up coverage\
  \ of both vector and raster geographic data models and consistent learning curve.\
  \ This book is an excellent starting point for those new to working with geographic\
  \ data with Python, making it ideal for students and practitioners beginning their\
  \ journey with Python.Key features: Showcases the integration of vector and raster\
  \ datasets operations. Provides explanation of each line of code in the book to\
  \ minimize surprises. Includes example datasets and meaningful operations to illustrate\
  \ the applied nature of geographic research. Another unique feature is that this\
  \ book is part of a wider community. Geocomputation with Python is a sister project\
  \ of Geocomputation with R (Lovelace, Nowosad, and Muenchow 2019), a book on geographic\
  \ data analysis, visualization, and modeling using the R programming language that\
  \ has numerous contributors and an active community.The book teaches how to import,\
  \ process, examine, transform, compute, and export spatial vector and raster datasets\
  \ with Python, the most widely used language for data science and many other domains.\
  \ Reading the book and running the reproducible code chunks within will make you\
  \ a proficient user of key packages in the ecosystem, including shapely, geopandas,\
  \ and rasterio. The book also demonstrates how to make use of dozens of additional\
  \ packages for a wide range of tasks, from interactive map making to terrain modeling.\
  \ Geocomputation with Python provides a firm foundation for more advanced topics,\
  \ including spatial statistics, machine learning involving spatial data, and spatial\
  \ network analysis, and a gateway into the vibrant and supportive community developing\
  \ geographic tools in Python and beyond."
