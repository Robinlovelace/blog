abstract: Origin-destination (OD) datasets are widely available but transport interventions
  require network level data. OD-‘desire line’-route-‘route network’ conversion techniques
  are typically based on lines between zone centroids. This approach fails to show
  the diffuse nature of travel patterns. This paper presents ‘jittering’ methods to
  overcome these limitations and seeks to assess them. We find that jittered OD datasets
  result in a closer fit between observed and estimated flow in a reproducible case
  study using open data in Edinburgh. We conclude that jittering can add value to
  OD but work is needed to parameteterise them in the context of route network generation
  techniques
