abstract: 'Route network datasets, crucial to transport models, have grown complex,
  leading to visualization issues and potential misinterpretations. We address this
  by presenting two methods for simplifying these datasets: image skeletonization
  and Voronoi diagram-centreline identification. We have developed two packages, the
  ‘parenx’ Python package (available on pip) and the ‘rnetmatch’ R package (available
  on GitHub) to implement these methods. The approach has applications in transportation,
  demonstrated by their use in the publicly available Network Planning Tool funded
  by Transport for Scotland.'
