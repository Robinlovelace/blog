abstract: Large and unofficial data sets, for instance those gathered from social
  media, are increasingly being used in geographical research and explored as decision
  support tools for policy development. Social media data have the potential to provide
  new insight into phenomena about which there is little information from conventional
  sources. Within this context, this paper explores the potential of social media
  data to evaluate the aesthetic management of landscape. Specifically, this project
  utilises the perceptions of visitors to the Pennine Way National Trail, which passes
  through land managed under the Environmental Stewardship Scheme (ESS). The method
  analyses sentiment in trail users’ public Twitter messages (tweets) with the aim
  of assessing the extent to which the ESS maintains landscape character within the
  trail corridor. The method demonstrates the importance of filtering social media
  data to convert it into useful information. After filtering, the results are based
  on 161 messages directly related to the trail. Although small, this sample illustrates
  the potential for social media to be used as a cheap and increasingly abundant source
  of information. We suggest that social media data in this context should be seen
  as a resource that can complement, rather than replace, conventional data sources
  such as questionnaires and interviews. Furthermore, we provide guidance on how social
  media could be effectively used by conservation bodies, such as Natural England,
  which are charged with the management of areas of environmental value worldwide.
