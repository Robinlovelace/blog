abstract: 'This paper describes an approach for developing strategic cycle network
  planning tools. Based on our experience developing and deploying the Cycle Route
  Uptake and Scenario Estimation (CRUSE) Tool for Ireland, we outline the underlying
  methods, including disaggregation of origin–destination data with the open source
  ‘odjitter’ software, incorporation of additional trip purposes, routing, scenario
  generation, and development of an intuitive user interface that is tested and used
  by practitioners. Commissioned by the national infrastructure agency Transport Infrastructure
  Ireland, CRUSE provides estimates of current and potential future cycling levels
  under ‘snapshot’ scenarios to inform investment decisions. The publicly available
  results at https://cruse.bike/enable planners, engineers, and other stakeholders
  to make more evidence-based decisions. CRUSE goes beyond previous work by: modeling
  networks at high spatial resolution; simulating multiple trip purposes (social,
  shopping, personal utility, recreational, and cycle touring), supplementing official
  origin–destination datasets on travel for work and education; and providing estimates
  of ‘quietness’ (a proxy for cyclist comfort and route preference) at the route segment
  level. Three network types—‘Fastest’, ‘Balanced’, and ‘Quietest’—help plan both
  arterial and residential cycle networks. Workshops with stakeholders were used to
  inform the development of the tool. Feedback shows that the tool has a wide range
  of uses and is already being used in practice to inform urban, inter-urban, and
  rural cycle network designs. The approach is flexible and open source, allowing
  the underlying ideas and code to be adapted, supporting more evidence-based and
  effective cycling policies and interventions internationally.'
