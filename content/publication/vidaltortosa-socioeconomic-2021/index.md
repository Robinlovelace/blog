abstract: Introduction Previous studies have found a positive association between
  cycling injury risk and residential deprivation. However, most of these studies
  focused on serious and fatal injuries, children, and a specific point in time. This
  study explores i) inequalities in cycling injury risk by residential deprivation
  for all recorded casualties (slight, serious, and fatal) in England, ii) whether
  these inequalities vary by sex and age, and iii) how they have changed over time.
  Methods Using the STATS19 database of road traffic casualties in Britain, the English
  National Travel Survey, and population estimates for England over the six-year period
  2014â€“2019, we estimated the ratio of slight, serious, and fatal cycling casualties
  per billion kilometres cycled by residential Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)
  quintile; by residential IMD quintile and sex and age group; and by residential
  IMD quintile and year. Results We found that the higher the level of residential
  deprivation, the higher the slight and serious cycling injury risk. The fatal cycling
  injury risk was also higher in individuals from the most deprived areas. Inequalities
  were particularly large for children, with slight and serious rates three times
  higher for children from the most deprived areas than for children from the least
  deprived areas. We also found that the linear trend lines of the slight and serious
  injury rates between 2014 and 2019 declined in the least deprived quintiles but
  not in the most deprived quintiles, which suggests that inequalities in slight and
  serious cycling injuries may have grown over the last years. Conclusion This study
  found that people from deprived areas are at higher risk of cycling injury for all
  types of severity; that children from deprived areas are most at risk; and that
  these inequalities may have recently increased.
