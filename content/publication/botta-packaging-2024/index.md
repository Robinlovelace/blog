abstract: 'The effective and ethical use of data to inform decision-making offers
  huge value to the public sector, especially when delivered by transparent, reproducible,
  and robust data processing workflows. One way that governments are unlocking this
  value is through making their data publicly available, allowing more people and
  organisations to derive insights. However, open data is not enough in many cases:
  publicly available datasets need to be accessible in an analysis-ready form from
  popular data science tools, such as R and Python, for them to realise their full
  potential. This paper explores ways to maximise the impact of open data with reference
  to a case study of packaging code to facilitate reproducible analysis. We present
  the jtstats project, which consists of a main Python package, and a smaller R version,
  for importing, processing, and visualising large and complex datasets representing
  journey times, for many transport modes and trip purposes at multiple geographic
  levels, released by the UK Department for Transport (DfT). jtstats shows how domain
  specific packages can enable reproducible research within the public sector and
  beyond, saving duplicated effort and reducing the risks of errors from repeated
  analyses. We hope that the jtstats project inspires others, particularly those in
  the public sector, to add value to their data sets by making them more accessible.'
