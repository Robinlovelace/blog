abstract: Background The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) is a freely available, interactive
  tool help prioritise cycling initially launched in England in 2017 and based on
  adult commuting data. This paper applies the method to travel to school data, and
  assesses health and carbon benefits based on nationwide scenarios of cycling uptake.
  Methods The 2011 National School Census provides origin-destination data for all
  state-funded schools in England (N = 7,442,532 children aged 2–18 in 21,443 schools).
  Using this dataset, we modelled propensity to cycle as a function of route distance
  and hilliness between home and school. We generated scenarios, including ‘Go Dutch’
  – in which English children were as likely to cycle as Dutch children, accounting
  for trip distance and hilliness. We estimated changes in the level of cycling, walking,
  and driving, and associated impacts on physical activity and carbon emissions. Results
  In 2011, 1.8% of children cycled to school (1.0% in primary school, 2.7% in secondary
  school). If Dutch levels of cycling were reached, under the Go Dutch scenario, this
  would rise to 41.0%, a 22-fold increase. This is larger than the 6-fold increase
  in Go Dutch for adult commuting. This would increase total physical activity among
  pupils by 57%, and reduce transport-related carbon emissions by 81 kilotonnes/year.
  These impacts would be substantially larger in secondary schools than primary schools
  (a 96% vs. 9% increase in physical activity, respectively). Conclusion Cycling to
  school is uncommon in England compared with other Northern European countries. Trip
  distances and hilliness alone cannot explain the difference, suggesting substantial
  unmet potential. We show that policies resulting in substantial uptake of cycling
  to school would have important health and environmental benefits. At the level of
  road networks, the results can inform local investment in safe routes to school
  to help realise these potential benefits.
