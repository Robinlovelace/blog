abstract: Origin-destination (OD) datasets are often represented as ‘desire lines’
  between zone centroids. This paper presents a ‘jittering’ approach to pre-processing
  and conversion of OD data into geographic desire lines that (1) samples unique origin
  and destination locations for each OD pair, and (2) splits ‘large’ OD pairs into
  ‘sub-OD’ pairs. Reproducible findings, based on the open source _odjitter_ Rust
  crate, show that route networks generated from jittered desire lines are more geographically
  diffuse than route networks generated by ‘unjittered’ data. We conclude that the
  approach is a computationally efficient and flexible way to simulate transport patterns,
  particularly relevant for modelling active modes. Further work is needed to validate
  the approach and to find optimal settings for sampling and disaggregation.
