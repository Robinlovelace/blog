abstract: Road traffic casualties represent a hidden global epidemic, demanding evidence-based
  interventions. This paper demonstrates a network lattice approach for identifying
  road segments of particular concern, based on a case study of a major city (Leeds,
  UK), in which 5862 crashes of different severities were recorded over an 8-year
  period (2011–2018). We consider a family of Bayesian hierarchical models that include
  spatially structured and unstructured random effects to capture the dependencies
  between the severity levels. Results highlight roads that are more prone to collisions,
  relative to estimated traffic volumes, in the north-west and south of city centre.
  We analyse the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP), proposing a novel procedure
  to investigate the presence of MAUP on a network lattice. We conclude that our methods
  enable a reliable estimation of road safety levels to help identify ‘hotspots’ on
  the road network and to inform effective local interventions.
