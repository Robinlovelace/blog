abstract: In the context of reduced public transport capacity in the wake of the COVID-19
  pandemic, governments are scrambling to enable walking and cycling while adhering
  to physical distancing guidelines. Many pop-up options exist. Of these, road space
  reallocation represents a ‘quick win’ for cities with ‘spare space’ along continuous
  road sections that have high latent cycling potential. We developed methods to condense
  the complexity of city networks down to the most promising roads for road space
  reallocation schemes. The resulting Rapid Cycleway Prioritisation Tool has been
  deployed for all cities in England to help prioritise emergency funds for new cycleways
  nationwide. The methods and concepts could be used to support investment in pop-up
  infrastructure in cities worldwide.
