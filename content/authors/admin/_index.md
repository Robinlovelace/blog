Hi, I'm Robin.
Welcome to my personable website ðŸŽ‰

I'm a data scientist, geographer, transport modeller, software developer, and writer.
This website should help you find out about my work.
I mostly use it to share and promote my [publications](https://www.robinlovelace.net/#featured) and [talks](https://www.robinlovelace.net/#talks) but I also occassionally share blog posts and other things here.
If you'd like to get in touch, see [here](https://www.robinlovelace.net/#contact).

[Associate Professor of Transport Data Science](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/transport/staff/953/dr-robin-lovelace) at the Leeds [Institute for Transport Studies](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/transport) where I research, develop and teach free, open, reproducible and internationally scalable techniques for working with data to support evidence-based policies.

I am author of papers and [books](https://www.robinlovelace.net/publication/#5) on transport planning, energy, geographic data analysis and modelling.
I lead the Transport Data Science [module](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS), which is available to students taking [Data Science and Data Analytics](https://courses.leeds.ac.uk/i071/data-science-and-analytics-msc) and [Data Science and Urban Analytics](https://courses.leeds.ac.uk/j135/urban-data-science-and-analytics-msc) courses at the University of Leeds.

<!--
I am a big advocate of education and lifelong learning, but also of the power of technology and science to improve the world.
A good example of this 'planning support systems' that can help invest funds more effectively to meet public policy objectives, e.g. for a zero carbon economy and to improve health and wellbeing through physical activity.
I am the lead developer of the Propensity to Cycle Tool (which is publicly available at [www.pct.bike](https://www.pct.bike)), which is used by dozens of local governments to plan and prioritise strategic cycle networks, and have seen first-hand how strong evidence generated through transparent data analysis processes (and other sources) can impact the world.

As of 2021 that is my calling and I hope this website provides useful/interesting/fun information/methods/ideas, especially in the realms of geographic data visualisation and transport planning.

Knowledge is power.
Through my work I aim to empower people working or studying for public benefit with tools to better understand and change the world around them.
Broadly defined, data science is about generating information, insight and ultimately knowledge from a range of data sources.
