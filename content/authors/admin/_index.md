Hi, I'm Robin.
Welcome to my website ðŸŽ‰

I'm a [Professor of Transport Data Science](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/transport/staff/953/dr-robin-lovelace) at the [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/) [Institute for Transport Studies](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/transport)(ITS), where I undertake research, develop software and web applications, and teach data science for evidence-based transport planning.

Here you can check out my [publications](https://www.robinlovelace.net/#featured) and [previous/upcoming talks](https://www.robinlovelace.net/#talks), with links aplenty to visual/audio/video content that you can read/listen/watch to in your own time ðŸ“–ðŸŽ§ðŸ“º
I share lots of code for data science and reproducible research, this could be a good place to find resources to get started and try out things if you're interested in reproducing or building on some of the work that I've done (which in turn builds on the work of others as all research does).
I also occasionally share blog posts and other things here.
If you'd like to get in touch, see [here](https://www.robinlovelace.net/#contact) ðŸš€

I lead the Transport Data Science [module](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/tds), which is available to ITS Masters students and MSc students at the University of Leeds taking [Data Science and Data Analytics](https://courses.leeds.ac.uk/i071/data-science-and-analytics-msc) and [Data Science and Urban Analytics](https://courses.leeds.ac.uk/j135/urban-data-science-and-analytics-msc) courses.

You can find me on various platforms, including <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@robinlovelace">Mastodon</a>, <a rel="me" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xDJHVCAAAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a>, and [GitHub](https://github.com/robinlovelace/).
